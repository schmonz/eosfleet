# What is this?

Fleet management for the half-sensible doofus with varied old laptops.

I want to be able to USB-boot a random machine, install an OS that will perform well, wait a bit, and have a consistently configured system. 

## How to use?

1. Boot the EndeavourOS live install environment
2. From the Welcome app, choose "Fetch your install customization file"
3. Enter this URL, then click OK:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schmonz/endeavour-sway-install/main/bootstrap.bash
```
4. Start the installer, choosing online installation and no desktop
   - I may be assuming you'll install exactly the way I do
5. On reboot, once the setup job completes, what you get is primarily [EOS Sway Community Edition](https://github.com/EndeavourOS-Community-Editions/sway)
   -- plus customizations to suit my hardware and personal taste.

## Which hardware?

- Apple MacBook Air 7,1 (11", 2015)
- Apple MacBook Pro 5,2 (17", 2009)
- IBM ThinkPad T60
- Lenovo Chromebook 100e
- Lenovo ThinkPad X270

## Which customizations?

- **Apps**: 1Password, Helium browser (default), Tailscale, LocalSend, Discord, Signal, Slack, Zoom, Teams, LibreOffice, rclone, CLion, Claude Code + Desktop, btop, tmux, etckeeper, and more
- **System**: Tailscale with DNS push and firewall; CUPS printing; etckeeper for `/etc`; reflector-sorted mirrors; Sway autologin via greetd
